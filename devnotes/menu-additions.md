could you now add the dharmachakra, hourglass, and house icons to @icons-sprite.svg ?  and then include them in the @nav.njk ?

when clicked, each of them should display a popup styled in the same manner as the @settings-button.njk @settings-popup.css 

the dharmachakra icon when clicked should display a popup that is merely the text contained within a random .md file in the folder. So each time you click the dharmachakra icon to display its popup, it would show you a different set of text randomly from one of the koan files.

When you click on the home icon, there is no popup... it should merely take you to the root home page: dame.is

When you click on the hourglass icon, it should open its popup which displays a live ticking clock with this readout:

10:03:01 EST (the current time in my time zone)
Day 130 / 365 (which day of the year it is)
Today, May 18, 2025 (current date)
Day 11689 (my day of life)
