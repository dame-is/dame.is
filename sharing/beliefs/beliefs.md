# /beliefs

The following list is a work-in-progress and is by no means comprehensive. I will likely fall short of my own ideals. Still, these are some of the things I strive towards and want to keep myself accountable to.

- **Give people the benefit of the doubt** (unless they have a track record of acting in bad faith). 
- **Practice non-judgment** as much as possible.
- **Avoid personal comparisons**, as they usually do more harm than good.
- **Maintain a beginner's mindset.** 
- **Be helpful and give without the expectation of return.**
- **Don't cultivate a personal "brand"**, let your "brand" be something that arises organically without intention or effort and that is only ever thought about by other people and not yourself.
- **Don't take yourself too seriously.**
- **Don't look down upon other generations,** both younger and older.
- **Avoid arguments and embrace discussions,** turn the former into the latter when possible.
- **Principles are good to have**, but sometimes there are scenarios where they don't apply.
- **Respect your elders**, but only true elders... being old doesn't make someone an elder.
- **There's always a bigger fish**. ([source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjQRTFX1Lp4))
- Impact is more important than intent, but intent still matters quite a bit.
- Everything is connected.
- Time spent is not an indicator of quality.
