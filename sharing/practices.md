a non-exhaustive work-in-progress list

- **Give people the benefit of the doubt** (unless they have a track record of acting in bad faith). 
- **Practice non-judgment** as much as possible.
- **Avoid personal comparisons**, as they usually do more harm than good.
- **Maintain a beginner's mindset.** 
- **Be helpful and give without the expectation of return.**
- **Don't cultivate a personal "brand"**, let your "brand" be something that arises organically without intention or effort and that is only ever thought about by other people and not yourself.
- **Don't take yourself too seriously.**
- **Don't look down upon other generations,** both younger and older.
- **Avoid arguments and embrace discussions,** turn the former into the latter when possible.
- **Respect elders**, but only true elders... being old doesn't make someone an elder.
