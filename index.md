title: About
---

I am a conceptual artist and remote tech worker residing in the southeastern United States. 

I first started publishing on the internet around 2003. This website was created in January 2025 and is a work-in-progress that I add to each month.

I'm a 90s kid whose birthday is almost the same as the release of the World Wide Web. I am agnostic and a casual practitioner of Zen Buddhism, with great appreciation for animism. I have a non-normative experience with gender and fall within the category of genderqueer or genderfluid. I have a small dog named Cooper who is a chihuahua/terrier mix.

My passion for art started at a young age through writing and photography. My art practice for the past 5 years has focused on conceptual and abstract art.

As a "professional", I've worked as a graphic designer, content creator, and communicator for various software startups. I recently ended a sabbatical and am now focused on building things within the AT Protocol ecosystem.

In regard to technology, I'm especially interested in...
- indie software
- emerging tech
- consumer health
- web apps

I love tennis and play weekly at my local club, sometimes in USTA leagues.
