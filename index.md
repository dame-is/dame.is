# Welcome

My name is Dame.

I am a conceptual artist and remote tech worker residing in the southeastern United States. I was born within a week of the World Wide Web's public release. I am agnostic and a casual practitioner of Zen Buddhism, with great appreciation for animism. I have a non-normative experience with gender, falling within the umbrella of genderqueer/genderfluid. I have a small dog named Cooper.

Iâ€™ve worked as a graphic designer, content creator, community manager, and communicator for various software startups. Currently I'm focused on making things within the AT Protocol ecosystem.

Here are some of my personality test results:
- Myers-Briggs: ENFJ
- Astrology: Taurus
- Enneagram: 2
- DISC: Support/Steadiness
