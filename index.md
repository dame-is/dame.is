# About

Welcome to my digital home.

My name is Dame, and I am a conceptual artist and remote tech worker residing in the southeastern United States.

I'm a 90s kid whose birthday is almost the same as the release of the World Wide Web. I am agnostic and a casual practitioner of Zen Buddhism, with great appreciation for animism. I have a non-normative experience with gender and fall within the category of genderqueer/genderfluid. I have a small dog named Cooper.

Over the years Iâ€™ve worked as a graphic designer, content creator, community manager, and communicator for various software startups. I recently ended a sabbatical and am now focused on building things within the AT Protocol ecosystem.

I love tennis and play weekly at my local club, sometimes in USTA leagues.

Here are some of my personality test results:
- Myers-Briggs: ENFJ
- Astrology: Taurus
- Enneagram: 2
- DISC: Support/Steadiness
