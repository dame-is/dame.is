# Welcome

My name is Dame.

I am a conceptual artist and remote tech worker residing in the southeastern United States. The World Wide Web and I have almost the same birthdate. I am agnostic and a casual practitioner of Zen Buddhism, with great appreciation for animism. I have a non-normative experience with gender, probably falling within the umbrella of genderqueer/genderfluid. I have a small dog named Cooper.

I’ve worked as a graphic designer, content creator, community manager, and communicator for various software startups. Currently I'm focused on making things within the AT Protocol ecosystem.

I love tennis and play weekly at my local club, sometimes in USTA leagues.

Here are some of my personality test results:
- Myers-Briggs: ENFJ
- Astrology: Taurus
- Enneagram: 2
- DISC: Support/Steadiness
