# Welcome

My name is Dame.

I am a conceptual artist and tech worker. 

I write a [microblog](/writing/posts) and a [macroblog](/writing/blogs).

I was born within a week of the World Wide Web's public release, so she and I are pretty close. 

I am agnostic-ish and a casual practitioner of Zen Buddhism, with great appreciation for animism. 

I have a non-normative experience with gender.

Iâ€™ve worked as a graphic designer, community manager, and writer for various software startups. Currently I'm focused on making things within the AT Protocol ecosystem.

Here are some of my personality test results:
- Myers-Briggs: ENFJ
- Astrology: Taurus
- Enneagram: 2
- DISC: Support/Steadiness
