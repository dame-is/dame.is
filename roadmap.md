# roadmap

## in progress
- 

## up next
- relative timestamps on /posts page, both for the day group headers and for the individual post timestamps
- live dynamic clock in the nav that is ticking, displaying current time and which day of my life it is (11450:5:39:20)
- update /log to include everything… statuses, posts, github commits, etc
- blog page

## eventually
- personal dame.is lexicons on my atproto PDS for various data… statuses, mood, exercise, water/food, health data, etc.
- art portfolio
- professional portfolio
- resume
- contact page
- newsletter 
- skeet.tools 

## ideas
- app, a section of all the software i’ve built
- an authenticated side of my site that is a personal atproto client
