## up next
- separate “posts” from “replies” in the nav’s bluesky metrics
- fix flash of white that happens when switching pages while in dark mode
- add support for post replies, quote posts, and links in posts
- restructure page URLs and sitemap to follow the gerund framing (dame.is/blogging, dame.is/posting, dame.is/logging, etc)
- add time to read indicator at the top of blog posts
- add skeleton loading indicators on posts and logs pages
- live dynamic clock in the nav that is ticking, displaying current time and which day of my life it is (11450:5:39:20)
- update /log to include everything… statuses, posts, github commits
- add RSS feed to blog

## eventually

- resume
- contact page
- newsletter 
- skeet.tools
- add engagement icons to posts instead of words
