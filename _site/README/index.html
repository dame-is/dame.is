<h2>my personal website</h2>
<p>I've had a personal website for over a decade, but it was never a fully customized site... it was always built with something like squarespace, wordpress, etc. For 2025, I've challenged myself to build a new website in public bit-by-bit, adding features to it each week rather than waiting to have a finished product before releasing it.</p>
<p>This is the github repo for my website! Welcome!</p>
