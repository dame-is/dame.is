<p>Yes, I’m a new year goals person... have been most of my life.</p>
<p>While the Gregorian calendar is probably not the best or most interesting framework for time, it is the most widely used across the planet, and it’s deeply embedded in my psyche, so I continue to find it helpful to make plans around. If it’s cringe to do so, then I’m cringe.</p>
<p>I don’t subscribe to any particular goal-setting methodology, but I do attempt to keep things organized, simple, and natural with a mix of both qualitative and quantitative measurements as is appropriate. I should note that I’m deeply suspicious of tech people who use OKRs or similar corporate paradigms for their personal or relational development.</p>
<p>Also, I don’t ever expect or hold myself to achieving all my goals to 100%. I’m usually satisfied as long as I make forward progress on things, especially if it ends up being like 50-70% of the way there. That’s not to say my goals are aspirational, it’s more just to say that I’m not a stickler.</p>
<p>Anywho, I wanted to provide that bit of context for all the new people I’ve met this year who aren’t familiar with my feelings on the topic yet.</p>
