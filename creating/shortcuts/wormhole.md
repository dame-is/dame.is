I found myself constantly needing to switch between Bluesky or AT Protocol clients, so I created an Apple Shortcut that let's you jump between apps while maintaining your relative position in terms of the data you're trying to view.

All you have to do is tap the "share" button and choose at://wormhole!

If you're browsing the Bluesky app and want to quickly look at an account or post inside a PDS explorer like pdsls.dev, it only takes one tap! With at://wormhole, you can instantly open a post within deer.social, check the account's cred.blue score, or look at its PLC logs with boat.

- supports did:web
- works with third-party PDS accounts
- includes 10+ apps/websites at launch
- update notification if new version is available

**Note:** If at://wormhole isn't appearing when you tap the "share" button, go into the Apple Shortcuts app, find the shorcut, tap the three dots icon in its top-right, and then find the information icon at the bottom of the screen to check that "Show in Share Sheet" is enabled."
