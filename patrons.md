Hello there,

My name is [Dame](https://bsky.app/profile/dame.is). I'm an artist and software experimentalist who is creating resources, tools, and content for the AT Protocol + Bluesky community.

So far I've created an [alt text rating tool](https://cred.blue/alt-text), a social scoring system called [cred.blue](https://cred.blue/), and a satirical social network called [Flushes](https://flushes.app).

Making projects like these requires a significant time investment as well as ongoing costs in the form of servers, hosting, and various services. It's my hope that through my Patreon and Ko-fi I'll be able to at least cover the upkeep costs of the various free tools I've made, and then eventually provide premium features to my supporters.

Thank you for considering supporting me,

Dame
