Hello there,

My name is [Dame](https://bsky.app/profile/dame.is). I'm an artist and software experimentalist who has been creating resources, tools, and content for the AT Protocol + Bluesky community for the past several months during my professional (unpaid) sabbatical. I've been a part of Bluesky since almost the very beginning (user #1,216), and I've developed a keen interest in helping make the "Atmosphere" better.

Recently I launched the beta version of a new platform I've created called cred.blue. It allows you to generate a Bluesky score, helps you understand your AT Protocol data footprint, and let's you vibe check strangers and new accounts. Bots, fake accounts, and bad actors are all over the place these days, so it's my hope that this platform can play a small part in helping you better navigate the digital spaces we inhabit.

Launching and maintaining a project of this nature requires a significant time investment as well as ongoing costs in the form of servers, hosting, and various services. It's my hope that through this Patreon I'll be able to at least cover the upkeep costs of the various free resources I've made. I should be able to do that well for around ~$350. Beyond that, I'm interested in focusing more of my time towards creating new projects, tools, and resources that can help people live healthier digital lives... both within the AT Protocol + Bluesky ecosystem and beyond.

Thank you for considering supporting me,

Dame
